This code was successfully used to run 2 Ebay Stores (pepauto , partforengine)  and 1 amazon store (partformotor)


Inventory Control, both virtual and inhouse
Automatic competition on Ebay
Price grabbing cron will scan competitors and it will automatically re-price ebay listing, changing price up and down to keep preset competitive position.



It's very messy and there is no framework used, yet its good enougth to run 3 stores with up to 5000 listings in each.

Contact me if you need help with installation.

I can help you if you want to rebuild it in some framework.

I will rebuild it in Zend 1.9 , Codeignitor or any php framework you prefer.
